# Introduction to UI Component Library

This component library is based on React, suitable for scenarios such as admin panels and management systems. It supports theme customization and offers a modern development experience. The component style is inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and optimized according to the actual needs of our team.
